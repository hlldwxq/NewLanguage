# June 26

TODOs:
  Fix Overflow in compiler constant propagation
    (- maybe use GMP library)
    - does LLVM provide functions to compute with large numbers?
      -> llvm/ADT/APInt.h

  Fix Overflow in number parser
    - must parse arbitrarily large numbers

  Add Overflow check for uminus:
    sint8 x=-128
    sint8 y = -x # OVERFLOW

  Free function.

  overflow checks for memory
    * array bounds checks (also optional)


  ** At this point, we might have reached minimal viable product
  ** What next?

  literature review on programming languages (important for final report):
    How does this project relate to others? To design ideas for PLs?
    What would be useful features to add at this point?
    -> possible starting points:
      textbook on PLs,
      modern PL, e.g. Rust, Java, Go, ...

  print function
    would make language self-contained enough for tests!
    requires: string type
    "easy" way: string = uint8*, and 'hardcode' printf with variable arguments (printf-command)
      printf("foo %s %l", x,y)

  implement a larger program, ideally
    * does something useful
    * is safety critical
    * has suffered form overflow problems in the past

  add more advanced features (?):
    * struct type
    * polymorphic types (templates) "vector<T>"



  Avoid repeated global string data for error messages.
    -> gets removed by compiler anyway.

  Should overflow-check also return result of computation?
    -> currently, result is computed twice
    -> ad-hoc test on x86 and add revealed: optimizer removes superfluous addition!






-------

  what do we have:
    - structure: functions, global vars
    - control flow: while, break, for, if
    - operations: malloc (with ovf check)
    - arith: +,-,*,/, (optional overflow check), uminus (no ovf check yet)
    - bitwise: &, |, ! (all bit sizes, and signs)
    - compare: <, <=, >, >=,

  Tests: lots of tests
